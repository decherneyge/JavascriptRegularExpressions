JavascriptRegularExpressions
============================

This project is a little site to help construct/test regular expressions that will be executed in javascript.

There are plenty of other regular expression tools but I wanted one that was specific to javascript because each language is a little different.

There are also plenty of other javascript regular expression sites out there but none of them have any design. They are mostly just big text boxes on a page where you can paste in your stuff. I believe every site should have at least some styling applied.

What's in v1?

- regular expression searching
- regular expression options
- groups
- mobile responsive site (so you can prove your regex theory at your co-workers desk!)

What's planned for the future?

- perma-links
- a match page
- list of common regular expression patterns for quick reference
- list of resources for other regular expression help
